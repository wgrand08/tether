# Introduction to Scorched Moon versions #

The client and server each have their own version numbers that are not going to be synced except at project milestones. As planned features are implemented they will be crossed off the list. When both the client and the server meet all planned requirements for a milestone release then they will both be moved from their current version number to the milestone version number.


# Versions #

Currently we are working towards milestone version 0.1

## Version 0.0 - complete ##

Up to version 0.1 we are working on the basic framework for both the server and the client. When done we should essentially have a "chat" system.

  * ~~server is capable of accepting incoming network connections~~

  * ~~server is capable of parsing basic chat commands~~
  * ~~server is capable of loading and parsing settings file~~
  * ~~client is capable of launching with GUI interface~~
  * ~~client is capable of switching between screens~~
  * ~~client is capable of connecting to server~~
  * ~~client is capable of logging into server with username~~
  * ~~client is capable of sending and receiving basic chat commands~~
  * ~~client is capable of displaying chat information so players can chat with each other~~


## Version 0.1 - reached ##

Version 0.1 to version 0.2 will focus on the map system. When done the server will be able to send map data to the client and the client will be able to display it properly and allow players to view it.

  * server is capable of creating individual games and allow players to join them
  * server is capable of creating simple random maps
  * server is capable of loading custom premade maps
  * server is capable of sending custom map data to client
  * ~~client is capable of loading, parsing, and saving settings file~~
  * client is capable of specifying custom game settings
  * client is capable of displaying map data
  * client is capable of dragging the map around so that the entire map can be seen

## Version 0.2 - in progress ##

Version 0.2 to 0.3 will focus on actual gameplay. By the end the game should be technically playable and we will have reached alpha stage.

  * server is capable of enforcing turns and rounds
  * server is capable of handling users energy
  * server is capable of calculating results of shots fired
  * server is capable of calculating movement of crawlers
  * server is capable of handling shields and AA's
  * client is capable of selecting units on the map
  * client is capable of sending fire data to server
  * client is capable of showing targeting indicator

## Version 0.3 - pending ##

Version 0.3 to 0.4 will focus on adding in features that are wanted but generally don't directly affect gameplay so can wait until gameplay is done. When done all the primary features we want in Scorched Moon should be done.

  * server is capable of having persistent user accounts
  * server is capable of limiting certain tasks to admin accounts only
  * server is capable of handling FoW and SoW
  * client is capable of playing sounds
  * client is capable of playing in-game music
  * client is capable of displaying a mini-map
  * client is capable of moving map by clicking on mini-map

## Version 0.4 - pending ##

Version 0.4 to 0.5 will focus on bugfixes and compatibility with windows and osX. When done we will be out of alpha and into beta.

## Version 0.5 - pending ##

Version 0.5 to 1.0 will be beta testing and resolving any further bugs found. At this point promotion of Scorched Moon will be a priority as we will need lots of beta testers. Setting up an official server will be necessary at this point so that people can connect to a game and play without having to host their own server.

## Version 1.0 - pending ##

At version 1.0 Scorched Moon will be complete. Any further work will be optional features not currently planned like a possible rank/ladder system.
